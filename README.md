# xsukax Color Picker

A modern, lightweight, and privacy-focused color picker application for Windows that enables precise color sampling from anywhere on your screen with real-time tracking capabilities.

## Project Overview

xsukax Color Picker is a native Windows desktop application built with C++ and the Windows API, designed to provide developers, designers, and digital artists with a powerful yet simple tool for color extraction and analysis. The application offers real-time color tracking, multiple color format support, and an intuitive modern interface that integrates seamlessly with Windows design principles.

The tool captures pixel-perfect color information from any location on your screen and presents it in commonly used color formats (HEX, RGB, HSL), making it invaluable for web development, graphic design, UI/UX work, and digital art creation.

## Security and Privacy Benefits

### **Complete Local Operation**
- **Zero Network Communication**: The application operates entirely offline with no network connections, ensuring your screen content and color data never leave your device
- **No Data Collection**: No user analytics, telemetry, or personal information is collected or transmitted
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only trusted Windows system APIs, eliminating third-party security risks

### **Minimal System Access**
- **Limited Permissions**: Requires only standard desktop access permissions for screen reading
- **No Administrative Rights**: Runs under standard user privileges without requiring elevation
- **Transparent Operation**: All functionality is clearly visible and user-controlled

### **Data Protection**
- **Ephemeral Data**: Color information exists only during active use and in clipboard when explicitly copied
- **No Persistent Storage**: No configuration files, logs, or cached data stored on your system
- **Secure Clipboard Integration**: Uses Windows' native clipboard API with no additional data retention

## Features and Advantages

### **Core Functionality**
- **Real-time Color Tracking**: Live color sampling as you move your cursor across the screen
- **Precise Color Picking**: Single-click color capture with visual confirmation
- **Multiple Color Formats**: Simultaneous display of HEX, RGB, and HSL values
- **One-Click Clipboard Copy**: Individual copy buttons for each color format
- **Cursor Position Display**: Real-time coordinate tracking for precise placement

### **User Experience**
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, contemporary design following Windows 11 design principles
- **Intuitive Controls**: Simple two-button operation (Track/Pick) with clear visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Smooth 30 FPS real-time updates during tracking mode
- **Visual Feedback**: Dynamic status messages and temporary title updates for user actions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: ESC key to quickly exit tracking mode

### **Technical Advantages**
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage with native Windows API implementation
- **High Performance**: Optimized for smooth real-time color sampling
- **System Integration**: Follows Windows theming and accessibility standards
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Compatible with Windows 7 through Windows 11
